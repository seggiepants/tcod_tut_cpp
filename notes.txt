tutorial: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_roguelike_tutorial_using_C%2B%2B_and_libtcod_-_part_1:_setting_up
getting started docs: https://libtcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/getting-started.html
github: https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod

suggests vcpkg and cmake.

vcpkg: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
cmake: https://cmake.org/

vcpkg: jump to getting started then unix

# linux
wants a sub-module so lets go back to the libtcod c++ tutorial and set that up.

Oh look a template already setup, lets use that (https://github.com/HexDecimal/libtcod-vcpkg-template).
git submodule update --init to grab vcpkg... takes a while to clone
a very long time, lets update CMakeLists.txt while waiting

changed the name and after failing a few times, the submodule init worked (had to login for some reason to a key chain thing)
cmake CMakeList.txt and now it is upgrading cmake -- grumble.

looks like it is now getting SDL2 (I thought I had that)
looks like I can pass in a define for emscripten, so that sounds nice.

More dependencies
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev
sudo apt install libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libegl1-mesa-dev
sudo apt install libibus-1.0-dev

slow but we got there in the end. Changed the window title kept the rest and I now have an executable that says 'Hello World'

Now back to the tutorial, lets go back to the tutorial, and make the first program. A lot of stuff like include file already there from the template, plus a lot more the tutorial doesn't cover.
first off init_root is deprecated, shouldn't be used and doesn't work with emscripten.
looks like we are using SDL2 event handling instead of tcod. Will probably stay with that.
Can't use TCODConsole::isWindowClosed() use SDL2 it says.
Looks like we have a global console object instead of calling library function commands
g_context.present(g_console); instead of TCODConsole::flush(); with a global context and console.
we have print but no put_char lets try at. Have to add .ch at the end to get to the char, but it works and eventually 
I finish part 1: setting up. I also added [ESCAPE] to quit and you can use cursors or wasd to move. 

Did some looking not really seeing the map generation stuff I wanted, at least not in the readthedocs.io main sidebar. I do see a bsp.hpp file in the full api list of files.
